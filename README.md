# Hoot Mobile

A mobile frontend for the Hoot + Lotide federated network of virtual communities... It's Hoot for your phone.

> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Hoot, is in fact, Lotide/Hoot, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Lotide plus Hoot. Hoot is not a social platform unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Federated system made useful by the Lotide corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full Platform as defined by Lotide.

Hoot connects to the federation of Lotide servers and communities.

The app's not done yet though. Please submit an issue for any bugs or feature requests.
