# Hoot Mobile

A mobile frontend for the Hoot + Lotide federated network of virtual communities... It's Hoot for your phone.

> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Hoot, is in fact, Lotide/Hoot, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Lotide plus Hoot. Hoot is not a social platform unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Federated system made useful by the Lotide corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full Platform as defined by Lotide.

## Features

Hoot connects to the federation of Lotide servers and communities. From there, it's kind of like Reddit.
Just much less prone to sensorship.

### Feed

A feed of posts from communities you subscribe to.
Now you can see all of the fun, totally-not-politically-charged media the internet has to offer.

### Comments

Own the libs by commenting with your superior anarco-capitalist-libertarian-communist intelect.

### Other stuff

You can even do things like critique the communist manifesto by signing into your account, collect leftist tears by changing the feed view from hot to new, change my mind by submitting a new post, and also other things!

The app's not done yet though. If you're complaints aren't helpful, get off my lawn!

## Setting up a Development Environment

React-Native requires [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to function.

### Yarn

Hoot Mobile uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for its build process. See [here]() to install.
